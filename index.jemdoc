== About me
I received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and technology
from Nanjing University in 2009 and 2016, respectively.

From 2017-01 to 2020-07, I was an assistant professor
with the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University.

[research.html My research interests include Distributed Computing and Formal Methods. ~~*<<more>>*]
