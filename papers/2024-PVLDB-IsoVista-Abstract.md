Transactional isolation is critical to the functional correctness of database management systems (DBMSs). Much effort has recently been devoted to finding isolation bugs and validating isolation fulfilment in production DBMSs. However, there are still challenges that existing isolation checkers have not yet fully addressed. For instance, they may overlook bugs, incur high checking overhead, and return hard-to-understand counterexamples.  We present IsoVista, the first black-box isolation checking system that encompasses all the following features. It builds on faithful characterizations of a range of isolation levels, ensuring the absence of both false positives and missed bugs in collected DBMS execution histories. IsoVista exhibits superior checking efficiency, compared to the state-of-the-art, and visualizes violation scenarios, facilitating the understanding of bugs found. It also supports profiling and benchmarking the performance of isolation checkers under various workloads, assisting developers of both DBMSs and checkers. We showcase all these features through user-friendly interfaces.
